You really missed me, I am touched. 

Most of the answers to the intentionally misleading article in the OP are included in the thread thanks largely to zorq and Canard, but spread over a number of posts they lose some of their explanatory impact. 

First of all the easy part, the things that didn't cause the housing collapse. 

[u]The CRA[/u]

[list][*]The CRA was law for forty years without causing a crisis in housing before it was accused of causing a crisis in housing. 
[*]The CRA didn't force any bank to write bad loans to fulfill their low dollar amount mortgage writing requirement, in fact it specifically required that the underwriting of the loans be on a firm basis.
[*]This is the only reason that banks exist, beyond enabling monetary savings and exchanges, to underwrite loans so that they go to people and companies who can pay them back.
[*]The CRA applied just to banks who accepted deposits from minority areas and required the banks to write loans in the minority areas equal to 50% of the total deposits that it accepted from the minority areas.
[*]The CRA allowed banks to use 50% of the minority deposits outside of the minority areas and I don't understand why?  
[*]The greatest number of banks affected by the CRA were minority owned banks obviously. 
[*]The CRA required the banks to write 10 fifty thousand dollar loans rather than one five hundred thousand dollar loan even though the latter was more profitable.
[*]Banks aren't businesses independent of the government wishes in how they do their business. 
[*]Banks depend on the ability to create money granted by the government. 
[*]The banks are the handmaidens of capitalism, they exist as part of the machinery of capitalism and to grant them independence from any oversight to use their ability to create money to finance speculation is very dangerous. 
[*]And yet that is where we were in 2000 due to the relentless, ideologically driven push to blindly deregulate everything.[/list] 

[u]The GSE's[/u]

[list][*]Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are mortgage repurchasers. 
[*]Fannie Mae buys mortgages from commercial banks. 
[*]Freddie Mac buys mortgages from the savings and loans, the thrifts, the building societies, etc. 
[*]The reason that they exist is to provide liquidity, money, to the housing mortgage market so that no qualified borrower is denied a mortgage because of the lack of moneyto lend to them.  
[*]This is a throwback to the days of the gold standard when the shortage of money to loan would hamstring the economy. 
[*]But banks are still constrained by their capital to loan ratio, it makes mortgages a profitable business for banks because they make money on the interest without the loan coming under their capital to loan ratio.
[*]Therefore the GRE's bought a lot of mortgages that eventually defaulted in the Great Recession. 
[*]The charters of the GRE's forbid them from buying non-qualifying mortgages,the so-called subprime mortgages. 
[*]The GRE's were private, shareholder owned companies, whose shareholders would keep the government from having to bail them out by absorbing the loss if something like the Great Financial Crisis happened. 
[*]It didn't work, the government ended up bailing out the shareholders of the GRE's. 
[*]The GRE's did buy subprime mortgages in spite of their charters to a large degree to satisfy their shareholders that the GRE's were doing everything possible to increase profits. 
[*]But these purchases of sub-prime mortgages came late in the cycle. 
[*]In other words the fact that the GRE's were private companies made the financial crisis more likely and deeper than it otherwise would have been. 
[*]The idiot clown prince of movement conservatism and neoliberalism, Donald Trump, is getting ready to announce that we are selling the GRE's to shareholders again.
[*]Something about those who don't understand history being doomed to repeat its mistakes should go here. 
[/list]
Both the argument that the CRA and/or the GRE's were responsible for the Great Financial Crisis completely ignores that the banking system of the US was not the source of sub-prime loans that caused the crisis. The derivatives of securitized sub-prime mortgages were created by the shadow banking system setup by Wall Street to try to claim some of the huge amount of money directed to the already rich in the last forty years by the efforts of the neoliberals and movement conservatism.

So what did cause the Great Financial Crisis and the Great Recession? 

[list][*]The financial markets are inherently instable, I will let Hyman Minsky say it; [/list] 
[quote]Stability leads to instability. The more stable things become and the longer things are stable, the more unstable they will be when the crisis hits. Success breeds a disregard of the possibility of failure.

Unless we understand what it is that leads to economic and financial instability, we cannot prescribe -- make policy -- to modify or eliminate it. Identifying a phenomenon is not enough; we need a theory that makes instability a normal result in our economy and gives us handles to control it.[/quote]
[list][*]So absent adult supervision the financial markets will dream up something to eventually cause a financial crisis that threatens the economy, see the Great Depression and highly leveraged stock purchases, the subprime mortgage backed securities of the 1920's.
[*]We have been converting wage increases into profits for forty years to the point where profits now soak up all of the economy's gains from innovation and the workers' gains in productivity consistent with the principles of the fantasy economics of neoliberalism, the economics that confuses the reality of our current economy with the fantasies of the unobtainable self-regulating free market economy that they claim will just happen if we get the government out of the economy. 
[*]What makes this a fantasy; 
[list][*]that there is a very good reason to believe that one of the main reasons that governments exist is because their economies needed supervision
[*]that there has never been a self-regulating free market economy in the history of the world
[*]although there has been many factor market economies, a necessary step to a self-regulating free market, but they always self-destructed before the free market could develop
[*]a factor market is one where not only is the output of the economy subject to a price setting market, nominally what our economy is, but all of the inputs to production of the goods are subject to price setting markets including labor, capital and the land
[*]factor markets all through history have always self-destructed when the balance between all of factors are tipped toward one of the factor providers, usually when the credit or the land providers come to dominate the government
[*]unfortunately for our free market enthusiasts here the balance of a factor market has always proven to be difficult to maintain for any time because all of the factor providers chafe under the market setting their rent or their wages or their interest rates and they immediately set out to tip the balance in their favor 
[*]this inevitable because the returns in a factor market are low for all of the providers, this is easy to see if you think about it; prices, wages, rents and interest rates are driven down to their minimum in a competitive market, the race to the bottom 
[*]it really doesn't matter, the chance that our economy could be turned into a true factor market are zero, the current push for the self-regulating free market is being sponsored by the corporations who believe that they could make more profits if the government regulations were lifted, one of the requirements for a factor market is that capital must be raised on a project basis which precludes having corporations as we know them
[*]this why the classical economists who the neoliberals are suppose to rely on for economic theory distrusted the corporations more than any other economic actor and why they looked to the government to reign in the corporations (corporations were called syndicates then) 
[/list]
[*]This huge amount of profits is by far greater than what corporations need to invest in new products and production facilities, in some years the corporate profits is have been six times the corporate investment.

[b]Much[/b] more damning than anything I have run into before on this.  It's not just the CRA mandating loans, the federal mortgage buyers required high percentages of mortgages with lower incomes.  It's not just that the feds would buy trash, but if you wanted to sell mortgages to them you basically had to write trash.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Loren Pechtel;678038][QUOTE=laughing dog;678002]The analysis of Peter Wallison - a rightwing Republican free marketer - is not accepted by many people familiar with the data.   Here is one critique of Wallison ([URL="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2011/07/12/10011/why-wallison-is-wrong-about-the-genesis-of-the-u-s-housing-crisis/"]https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2011/07/12/10011/why-wallison-is-wrong-about-the-genesis-of-the-u-s-housing-crisis/[/URL]) that includes
[QUOTE]
The U.S. government’s market share of home mortgages was actually declining precipitously during the housing bubble of the 2000s......

Mortgages originated for private securitization defaulted at much higher rates than those originated for Fannie and Freddie securitization, even when controlling for all other factors (such as the fact that Fannie and Freddie securitized virtually no subprime loans). Overall, private securitization mortgages defaulted at more than six times the rate of those originated for Fannie and Freddie securitization....

nstead, what Wallison and Pinto do—the key to their argument—is to expand the definition of “high risk” and “subprime” to include new categories of loans not ordinarily understood to be high risk. This expansion of “high-risk” lending is essential to the Wallison/Pinto argument that the mortgage crisis was caused by federal affordable housing policies.....[/QUOTE]

In short, Wallison's view is not supported by the actual data.[/QUOTE]

Which, once again, ignores the fact that the worst of the damage was due to the junk standards the government set for buying mortgages becoming the standard.

The reason I posted this is because many of you have insisted the CRA didn't require the writing of junk loans.  With the % of loans that had to be low income how could they do that without writing junk?[/QUOTE]

It really does make you wonder how different....and how much better off all of us would be if Al Gore had won in 2000 instead of Bush.  And that history was all decided on the basis of one Supreme Court decision.  Talk about a butterfly effect of the first order.[/QUOTE]

The government had been encouraging and subsidizing home ownership for decades before Bush you know.  Was he just such a masterful leader and orator that people couldn’t resist his encouragements?

And, given it was Bush’s skills that caused the rise, it’s odd that when you look at a graph of US home ownership rates you’ll see it started trending up rapidly in about 1994 with no particular acceleration when Bush took over.[/QUOTE]

Easily. 

Simply by only writing loans for properties that the customers can actually afford. It doesn't matter what your customer base's income is.

The mortgage industry doesn’t win by writing loans to people who can’t afford them.

Any reasonable explanation would be required to explain why these greedy capitalists in the mortgage industry did things that were not consistent with sound business practices.[/QUOTE]
