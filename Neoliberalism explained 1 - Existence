-- and its place in the history of liberalism

[i]I am cleaning out my text files of posts that I never posted. Some like this one go back years. Most weren't posted because they were too long and I am aware that this a forum where not many bother with posts that are long. 

This series of [/i]Neoliberalism Explained[i] was intended to let me refer someone to to relieve me of having to repeat myself over and over. It also will provide a benchmark of my thinking at this time to measure against possible future changes in these positions. 

I am an engineer and a pilot. These are endeavors that discourage fantastical thinking and ideology over reality. [/i]



We have had a very good thread on neoliberalism already, [url="http://talkfreethought.org/showthread.php?7989-Neoliberalism-Explained"]Neoliberalism Explained[/url] posted by Cheerful Charlie. He presented a good article from [i]The Guardian: [url="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot"]Neoliberalism – the ideology at the root of all our problems[/url],[/i] 15 April 2016.

Since then, Auxlus has a posted a thread [url="http://talkfreethought.org/showthread.php?8944-I%E2%80%99m-a-neoliberal-Maybe-you-are-too"][i]I’m a neoliberal. Maybe you are too[/i][/url], based a blog post by Sam Bowman, Executive Director of the @ASI, an unabashed and proud neoliberal.

The Guardian article is primarily concerned with the damage done to our economies, mainly the Anglo-American ones, by neoliberal policies. These are serious problems. The success of neoliberalism is the single biggest threat to our capitalistic economy. 

If you have ever wondered why everything seemed to go to shit starting in 1980. Why private debt ballooned from 60% of the national income then to over 300% in 2008. Or why incomes seemed to stagnate starting then, the median income increasing only 8% real over the 36 years. Or why health care costs increased by nearly 900% nominal (895%, I looked it up) while the cost of living went up by 290%. Or why so many factories and the good jobs in them disappeared. Or why 3 million illegal immigrants ballooned to over 12 million in 2008. Or why the costs of college increased by more than 1100% nominal. Or why corporate profits went up 792% before and 899% after taxes to the peak in 2014. Or why the Dow Jones Average gained an astonishing 2322% to 25 November 2016. Or why the cost of the average home increased by 560%. Or why the income inequality in the US climbed to exceed the levels of the Glided Age and now threatens Mexico's. Or why the housing market crashed in 2008 nearly destroying the world's economy. 

A reasonable single answer for all of these is neoliberalism. 

Neoliberals have a lot of different excuses why these occurred, mostly lies, i.e. automation, the erosion of the work ethic, excessive regulation, the CRA, Freddie Mae and Fannie Mae caused the housing crash, the lack of savings by the middle class, or non-specific ones, i.e. unknown factors, market forces, or even shit happens. But they can't explain why all of these have occurred just since 1980. 

If you are a believer in any or all of the following; the self-regulating "free market," market fundamentalism, free trade, supply side economics, Reaganomics, Thatcherism, Milton Friedman's Chicago school of economics, Austrian economics, deregulation, privatization, government does nothing well, corporations can do no wrong if they are pursuing profits, greed is good, almost anything the government does can be handled better by private enterprise, that we should run the government like a business, that we that the poor are responsible for their own poverty, the need for budget austerity, the Washington Consensus, that we are burdening our children with unconscionable levels of national debt, crime running rampant, taxes are thief, that rule by the majority democracy itself, is a threat to individual freedom, that money is free speech, that corporations are people too, that the socialists are winning, that both communism and fascism are the products of radical liberalism and that conservatism cannot go too far to the right, that the mainstream media is too liberal, that Fox News demonstrates high levels of journalistic integrity, that conservatives don't have to lie to themselves and to each other;

you are; a libertarian, a member of any of the varieties of movement conservatism; a neoconservative,  a social conservative, the alt-right, a theocratic conservative, an ultimate conservative, an evangelical/fundamentalist Christian conservative, etc.;

you are; a white supremacist, a John Bircher, a neo-Nazi, a classical liberal, a Republican, a New Democrat, a Tory, New Labour, etc.;

You are a victim of neoliberalism and the manifestations of the vast Neoliberal Thought Collective. 

A thought collective is a group dedicated to a central core of ideas and beliefs that they are allowed to explore and to implement in different ways, with the understanding that they can never deviate from or question the collective's core beliefs. 

The core of the Neoliberal Thought Collective, is pretty easy to figure out, from its beginning after the Great Depression to the most recent Republican election platform, its core beliefs have been constant; free markets, free trade, the gold standard, deregulation, privatization, and the abolition of welfare and the other forms of socialism and social democracy. (Yes, the gold standard receives less than enthusiastic support recently. In the 2016 Republican platform it was reduced to metal backed currency, presumably bimetallism, bolding establishing them with the reforms of the 1890s. I will still call it support for the gold standard trusting that you will substitute the words with this minor caveat.) 

[hide]This is not the neoliberalism as the term is defined by Bowman, Axulus and Ben Southwood, an attempt to close the distance between Hayek and Friedman's neoliberalism and social democracy, specifically the European idea of social democracy, ordoliberalism. 

Like all self-defining statements seem to be, it is more moderate than the original and the actual practice of the doctrine. I see very little evidence that this more benign version of neoliberalism exists in practice. The closest I can come up with is George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism, which was conservative but wasn't very compassionate as Bush II tried to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Food Stamps.  

Since we are presented with the possibility of two different neoliberalisms here there is a need to name them. I will call Axulus' and Bowman's neoliberalism, Socially Responsible Neoliberalism, SRN for short, and my and the Guardian's destructive, umbrella, rather vulgar neoliberalism, the Neoliberal Thought Collective, the NTC, a designation gaining traction among opponents of neoliberals. 

Bowman distilled this into nine principles of his Social Responsible Neoliberalism, headlined as, 

[list=1][*]We like markets a lot.
[*]We are liberal consequentialists. (That is they only pursue policies that can be shown to work, e.g., they probably oppose supply side economic policies because they don't work.)
[*]We care about the poor. 
[*]We care about the welfare of everyone in the world, not just those in the UK. 
[*]We base our beliefs on empirics, not principles.
[*]We try not to be dogmatic. 
[*]We think the world is getting better. 
[*]We believe that property rights are very important. 
[*]But we are comfortable with redistribution, in principle.[/list]
I would say that this is similar to the Libertarian philosophy principles, they are hard to argue against as bullet points. And like the Libertarian philosophy principles the objections to them are in buried in the details of how the principles are applied. Fortunately for the purposes of our discussion here, unlike the Libertarians, the Social Responsible Neoliberals have provided us with more than just abstract bullet points. And we have forty years of actual policies generated in the name of the Neoliberal Thought Collective to explore and finally to judge if they meet the standards of the socially responsible neoliberals. .

The "neoliberal" label was first used in the late 1930's by two Austrian/Libertarian economists, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich August von Hayek, to describe their political and economic movement. A movement founded largely to counter the large and growing acceptance of Keynesian economics, based on John Maynard Keynes' [i]General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money[/i]. 

But neoliberalism isn't just economics. It is a political movement also. A political movement that first and foremost is organized to promote the role of capital and to boost the returns to capital, i.e. profits. In this aspect more significant than the start of the movement in Paris was the founding of the [url="https://www.montpelerin.org/"]Mt. Pelerin Society[/url] in 1947, along with Milton Friedman and 

Their neoliberalism would be more properly called "neo-classical liberal" economics, because they went back to the economics of the classical liberal period, that applied the theories of the classical economists, Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Say, etc. and the classical liberal philosophers and enlightenment thinkers, Adam Smith again, Locke, Hobbs, Voltaire, JS Mill, Kant, Bertram, etc. to the economy in England starting with the repeal of the so-called Corn Laws, protective tariffs on imported grain and the repeal of the Poor laws and open welfare, payments to the poor, all in the 1830's. 

From Wikipedia, 

[quote]Classical liberalism is a political ideology and a branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties and political freedom with representative democracy under the rule of law and emphasizes economic freedom.[/quote]

The classical liberals wanted to establish not only an economy based on a self-regulating market, but an entire society based on markets along with the obvious ones that we would recognize today they wanted 

The pertinent tenets of classical liberalism to neoliberalism are quite familiar to modern ears largely because of the success of the Neoliberal Thought Collective started by Mises and Hayek in Paris in 1938. They are, 

[list][*]Free trade and open borders including the free movement of capital, that is, money.
[*]A true labor market.
[*]A strict gold standard for money.[/list]





Neoliberalism is at its core was from the very beginning a political project to restore the power of the upper class. In the first two decades of it starting in 1980 the percentage of the national income of the nation of the top 0.1% of the income earners in the US went from 2% to 6%. [/hide]
