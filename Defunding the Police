=====================================

There are many places to get the money required to redirect money from the ineffective policing to programs that would actually reduce crime. 

Once again, the US is a veritable police state compared to other highly developed countries, with over 800,000 sworn officers, twice the number of police [i]per capita[/i] than Germany. #2 on the list. Reduce the number of the police and use the money saved. 

The police in the US are poorly organized into no less than 18,000 different agencies. This is highly inefficient. Everything that the police are concerned with, personnel, procedures, training, recruiting, detention, health care, etc. have to be duplicated 18,000 times. Untold time is wasted in jurisdictional questions. Reorganize the nation's police agencies into national or statewide police forces and use the savings from the reorganization.

Criminality in the US is concentrated in the poor and the upper class. The most honest is the middle class. So increase the wages of the poor which will increase the middle class while reducing profits and the incomes of the unearned income, coupon clipping upper class, moving some into the middle class. This solves many of our current problems besides policing. 

See, the solutions are simple. You just have to think outside of the neoliberal box that we have been in for fifty years or so.
